# Embedded-Systems
Source code for TEJ3M1 Robot (Gr.11 Computer Engineering)

Here you can find the source code that was written for my embedded systems group project.
There are 3 folders:
- c
- lst
- map

"c" contains the actual source code that was written in C. These are the actual
files that we wrote, and there are clearly many of them. This project was 1.5 months 
long, requiring us to write different source codes to accomplish different tasks.

"lst" contains the assembly code (compiled from the C source code files). 
Not all of the C files have a corresponding .lst file, and not all .lst files
were written by me or my group members.

"map" contains the linker files for the compiler(???). I think that's what it is
just from looking at it, but we never actually directly accessed and modified 
these file while working on the project.
